                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4">At the start of our project, we were prompted with the challenge of streamlining YASU’s financial assistance system (or FAS), which means improving or simplifying the end to end process of a member applying for the FAS to the member receiving the grant, and all the steps in between. In the early stages of our research, we were able to better understand how the staff operates, what tools are in play, how the members engage in the system, and how workflows are interconnected. From there, we were able to understand and analyze the current “what is” state of YASU with regards to membership, grants, and programs. We then translated our data and findings to create a future “what could be” model that focuses on YASU scaling from a member, support, and operations perspective.</p>

                            <p>Currently, members find out about YASU and the services offered through Google search, which requires support though website management and email. This also creates a burden on YASU staff, as they have to use a variety of tools and resources to bring in new members and grow the organization using unsustainable processes.</p>

                            <p>Distributing grant funding through financial aid is a major feature among YASU’s services. However, the current state of this service requires a lot of backend work, and forces YASU staff to work inefficiently, stealing time away from growth strategies for the organization.</p>

                            <p>YASU’s programs fall under four main categories, including support groups, social events, workshops/informational events, and forming connections. Each of these four areas has its own processes, yet there is still a large overlap For each area, members have to find, register, and then receive the information they need. When this occurs, YASU staff are required to operate a multitude of tools and handle a large amount of information to make sure the program is running smoothly.</p>

                            <p>Attending workshops proves to be an desirable experience among YASU members. Interview participants have described the positive effect these programs have on their lives. Many of them have expressed that there was difficulty attending events due to their 
                                schedule or current health status. Currently, the misalignment between members and YASU staff involves the need to track impact and attendance of events. There is a valuable opportunity to explore ways for members to have greater planning and individualization 
                                of support groups, and YASU staff able to document the activity of their community.</p>

Creating a systematic process to get feedback from members and track their engagement across services will allow YASU to evolve the organization based on member needs.</p>

                                <h3 class="h4 mb-2">Empower member advocacy and peer support</h3>
                                <p>Creating systems for volunteer work, both from YASU members and people outside the organization, will allow for support to travel to parts of the organization that weren’t engaged before.

                                <p>Clearly defining and delegating responsibilities to avoid overlap in workflows will enable YASU to hire more staff as they expand. There is also a stronger need for more facilitators for support groups, with qualification standards and training to ensure that support groups can continue to have high impact as YASU grows.</p>
