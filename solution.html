Being someone who has a hard time introducing topics by themselves, a user may not get to talk about what is bothering them that day during the support group.

                            Through our proposed solution of incorporating short 1-min polls at the beginning of every support group session - the facilitator can use the anonymous polls to steer conversations that can benefit all support group attendees.
